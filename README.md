# SpotifyBot
This is a personal project to analyze my spotify listening history, and using this data create new playlists, add new music to my library, remove unwanted songs, etc... for myself. 
The project uses IBM Tone Analyzer for lyrical analysis. The lyrics are retrieved from https://genius.com through HTML parsing with JSoup. The project runs on its own HTTPServer which was created using Oracle's com.sun.net.httpserver. The project also incorporates Adam Ratzman's Java Spotify Wrapper(https://github.com/adamint/spotify-web-api-kotlin).
